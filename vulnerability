The version of OpenJDK installed on the remote host is prior to 7 <= 7u361 / 8 <= 8u352 / 11.0.0 <= 11.0.17 / 13.0.0 <= 13.0.13 / 15.0.0 <= 15.0.9 / 17.0.0 <= 17.0.5 / 19.0.0 <= 19.0.1. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the 2023-01-17 advisory.
Please Note: Java CVEs do not always include OpenJDK versions, but are confirmed separately by Tenable using the patch versions from the referenced OpenJDK security advisory.

- Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: JSSE). Supported versions that are affected are Oracle Java SE: 11.0.17, 17.0.5, 19.0.1;
Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.8, 21.3.4 and 22.3.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via DTLS to compromise Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). (CVE-2023-21835)

- Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Serialization). Supported versions that are affected are Oracle Java SE: 8u351, 8u351-perf;
Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.8 and 21.3.4. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data.
Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). (CVE-2023-21830)

- Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Sound). Supported versions that are affected are Oracle Java SE: 8u351, 8u351-perf, 11.0.17, 17.0.5, 19.0.1; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.8, 21.3.4 and 22.3.0. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). (CVE-2023-21843)

Note that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.
